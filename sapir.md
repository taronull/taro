# Sapir - a sensible keyboard layout

```

```

Sapir is a keyboard layout for comfortable typing. It features

- Extremely low single-finger bigram percentage
- Ergonomics for fingers, especially for shorter pinkies

## Layout

Sapir is based on Whorf layout: 

```
f l h d m v w o u ,
s r n t k g y a e i
x j b z q p c ' ; .
```

> Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf are known for _Sapir–Whorf hypothesis_. Although, they never co-authored any work or call it a hypothesis. The concept describes [linguistic relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linguistic_relativity) where thoughts are shaped by the language used. 

Whorf is a purely algorithmic layout. It's optimised for shortest path travelled 2-dimensionally. The essence of Whorf is the vowels on the right-hand side. Sapir relocates consonants to add human factors. Least used keys are placed on the outer corners. This is especially comfortable for relatively shorter pinkies.

## Options

### Shifted punctuations & Hidden comma

```
" : .
' ; ,  
```

Full/double punctuations can be more frequent than their semi/single counterparts. If this is your case, Sapir recommends shifted punctuations. 

Comma is layered on full stop. If you want separate comma key, you can change backtick to comma like Whorf.

### Layers 

If available, Sapir recommends using layers.

Delimiters and a numpad takes the lower layer. 

```
  [ ] <   - 7 8 9 /
| ( ) =   + 4 5 6 *
  { } >   0 1 2 3 . 
         _
```

Symbols are mapped on the upper layer.

```

$ % # ~     ^ @ & !
            ? ' ; , \
         - 
```

As you see, underscore and hyphen are associated with space. 

### AltGr & non-printables

```
⎋ Ω ¬ ˙ © œ ∆ ƒ ø ¨ ` ⇥ 
⌫ ß ® ˜ † µ ¥ ç å ´ ˆ ⏎ 
⇧ √ ≈ ∫ ∂ ˚ ∑ π Æ Ú ≥ ÷
^ ⇪ ⌥ ⌘ ▽  ␣  △ ↑ ↓ ← → 
```

Caps-lock is moved down for more used keys. Backspace and tab are swapped. Arrow keys are matched by directions and deviates from the Vim default. 

### ANSI mod

```
z l h g q j f o u ` 
 s r n t m y c a e i / 
  x b d k v w p ' ; , 
```
